nds-bootstrap is currently a proof-of-concept, and is far from complete. Expect long loading times and compatibility issues. It is highly recommended that you check and bookmark the [compatibility chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M7MxYQzVhb4604esdvo57a7crSvbGzFIdotLW0bm0Co/edit#gid=0){:target="_blank"}.

SRLoader is a homebrew application that will allow you to run homebrew applications, as well as commercial ROMs using [nds-bootstrap](https://github.com/ahezard/nds-bootstrap){:target="_blank"}. SRLoader also has various emulators built in, as well as a GBA runner, which will let you run Gameboy Color, NES and GBA ROMs.

## Installation
1. Insert your system's SD card into your computer

3. Copy ROMs to their respective folders
