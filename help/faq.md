## Can I install HiyaCFW without Flipnote Studio?

No, you will need a hardmod to install HiyaCFW. Follow Gadorach's [hardmodding guide](https://gbatemp.net/threads/dsi-downgrading-the-complete-guide.393682/){:target="_blank"} to hardmod your DSi. Previous soldering experience is required.

## Can I use an SD card higher than 2GB with HiyaCFW yet?

Yes, using DSiMenu++. See the [Replacing System Menu with DSiMenu++](/more/replacing-system-menu/) page for more information.
