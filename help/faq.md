## Unlaunch freezes at "LOADING FAT"

- Delete any DSiWare installed via twlnf in the past
  - Make sure you have another homebrew entrypoint available
- If you have not installed any DSiWare via twlnf, or the above method doesn't work, try installing [Unlaunch via TempNAND](/more/installing-unlaunch-(tempnand))
  - Reflashing the NAND can cause severe degredation
  - This method should only be used as a last resort
- If neither methods work, please ask on [Discord](/help/discord)

## Can I install HiyaCFW without Flipnote Studio?

No, you will need a hardmod to install HiyaCFW. Follow Gadorach's [hardmodding guide](https://gbatemp.net/threads/dsi-downgrading-the-complete-guide.393682/){:target="_blank"} to hardmod your DSi. Previous soldering experience is required.

## Can I use an SD card higher than 2GB with HiyaCFW yet?

Yes, using DSiMenu++. See the [Replacing System Menu with DSiMenu++](/more/replacing-system-menu/) page for more information.
