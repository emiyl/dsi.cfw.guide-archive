5. Take your SD card out of your console and insert it into your computer
6. Copy the contents of the ugopwn `.zip` file to the root of your SD card
  - Only for USA consoles
7. Copy the contents of the twlnf `.7z` file to the root of your SD card, and rename `twlnf.nds` to `boot.nds`

9. Open the SD card drive on your computer
10. Navigate to /Private/DS/Title/
11. Copy the `.bin` file to your DSi SRL Extractor folder

13. When prompted, press Enter
14. Copy the new console_id `.txt` file to the root of your SD card
15. Eject your SD card and insert it back into your DSi

## Creating a NAND backup

1. Open the Flipnote Studio application
  - Ensure that the *booting to Calendar mode* is disabled in Flipnote Studio's settings
  - If you already have another DSiWare exploit installed, open that and skip to Step 14
2. Select **View Flipnote > SD Card > Select Folder > User > ugopwn**
3. Click on the note with the red bottom half
4. Select "Edit"
5. Click on the Flipnote frog icon in the bottom left
6. Click on the film roll icon
7. Select **Copy > Back > Exit**
8. Click the second note.
9. Click on the Flipnote frog icon in the bottom left
10. Click on the film roll icon.
11. Click on the single right arrow (the next to last arrow icon) two times
  - You will see a new frame be created
12. Click on the paste button exactly 122 times.
13. Select "Erase" and then "Paste"
  - This should launch twlnf
14. When prompted, press **A** to create a nand backup
  - This will take a few minutes
  - Store this NAND backup in a safe location, it is a critical backup and we will need it later to install HiyaCFW
15. Press **B** to quit twlnf
  - Your console will power off

## Installation

1. Insert your system's SD card into your computer
2. Copy `BOOT.NDS` from the `hbmenu` folder in the HBMenu `.tar.bz2` file to the root of your SD card
  - twlnf is currently your `boot.nds`; for now, rename it to `boot.bak` or `twlnf.nds`
3. Copy `UNLAUNCH.DSI` from the Unlaunch `.zip` file to the root of your SD card
4. Rename `UNLAUNCH.DSI` to `unlaunch.nds`
5. Unplug your SD card, and insert it in your DSi
6. Power on your DSi, and repeat steps 1 through 13 in **Creating a NAND backup**
  - HBMenu should appear
7. Navigate to `unlaunch.nds`, and press **A**
  - Unlaunch's installer should appear
8. Navigate to `INSTALL NOW` and press **A**
  - If Unlaunch freezes at `LOADING FAT`, please read our [FAQ](/help/faq)
9. When done, navigate to `POWER DOWN` and press **A**
  - Your system will power off
10. Turn your system on, to verify Unlaunch installed properly
  - You should briefly see the Unlaunch screen, and boot into a version of the DSi Menu with no sound

With Unlaunch installed, your system now has primitive brick protection, unless the launcher's TMD file is destroyed. Unlaunch has protections that should prevent this from happening, and HiyaCFW uses your SD card as the DSi's NAND, making your system theoretically unbrickable.
