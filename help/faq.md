## Unlaunch freezes at "LOADING FAT"

- Delete any DSiWare installed via twlnf in the past
  - Make sure you have another homebrew entrypoint available
- If you have not installed any DSiWare via twlnf, or the above method doesn't work, try installing [Unlaunch via TempNAND](/more/installing-unlaunch-(tempnand))
  - Reflashing the NAND can cause severe degredation
  - This method should only be used as a last resort
- If neither methods work, please ask on [Discord](/help/discord)

## Can I use an SD card higher than 2GB with HiyaCFW yet?

No, not yet.
