## Requirements
- The latest release of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/){:target="_blank"}
  - You should already have this from previous section
- An SD card that is 2GB or smaller, or a larger SD card that is partitioned to be 2GB or smaller
- The latest release of [twlnf](https://github.com/Jimmy-Z/twlnf/releases){:target="_blank"}
- The latest release of [HiyaCFW](https://github.com/Robz8/hiyaCFW/releases){:target="_blank"}
- The latest release of [ugopwn](/assets/files/ugopwn.zip)
- [NUSDownloader](/assets/files/NUSDownloader.zip)
- A NAND backup taken from your device, with the NO$GBA Footer
  - twlnf will create this footer automatically when it makes a backup
  - You should already have this backup from the previous section
- [Helper scripts for HiyaCFW installation](/assets/files/hiyacfw_helper.zip)

## Preparation
1. Insert your <2GB SD card into your PC
2. Copy *the contents of* the NUSDownloader `.zip` file to a folder on your PC
3. Copy *the contents of* the HiyaCFW `.7z` file to a folder on your PC
4. Copy *the contents of* the HiyaCFW helper `.7z` to the `for PC` folder in your HiyaCFW folder
5. Copy *the contents of* the ugopwn `.zip` file to the root of your <2GB SD card
5. Copy *the contents of* the twlnf `.7z` file to the root of your <2GB SD card, and rename `twlnf.nds` to `boot.nds`
6. Copy `console_id.txt` from the root of your normal SD card to the root of your <2GB SD card
  - Of course, this only applies if your <2GB SD card is not your normal one
7. Copy `nand.bin` and `nand.bin.sha` from the root of your normal SD card to the root of your <2GB SD card
8. Open NUSDownloader on your computer
  - This can be done through [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/) on Mac/Linux/*nix systems
9. Check the "Create Decrypted Contents (*.app)" box, and uncheck the "Keep Enc. Contents" box
10. Select **Database > System (DSi) > System Menu (Launcher) > [Your Region] > v512 > Start NUS Download!**
11. Exit NUS Downloader
12. Navigate to **titles > 00030017484e41XX > 512** in your NUS Downloader directory
13. Copy `00000002.app` from the `512` folder to the HiyaCFW `for PC` folder
14. Copy your valid NAND backup (`nand.bin`) to the HiyaCFW `for PC` folder

## Instructions
1. Insert your <2GB SD card into your system
2. Power on your DSi
3. Open the Flipnote Studio application
  - Ensure that the *booting to Calendar mode* is disabled in Flipnote Studio's settings
  - If you already have another DSiWare exploit installed, open that and skip to Step 16
4. Select **View Flipnote > SD Card > Select Folder > User > ugopwn**
5. Click on the note with the red bottom half
6. Select "Edit"
7. Click on the Flipnote frog icon in the bottom left
8. Click on the film roll icon
9. Select **Copy > Back > Exit**
10. Click the second note.
11. Click on the Flipnote frog icon in the bottom left
12. Click on the film roll icon.
13. Click on the single right arrow (the next to last arrow icon) two times
  - You will see a new frame be created
14. Click on the paste button exactly 122 times.
15. Select "Erase" and then "Paste"
  - This should launch twlnf
16. Press **X** to mount the system NAND directly
17. Press **START** to open twlnf's menu
18. Press **R** to dump the NAND contents to your SD card
  - This will take several minutes
  - Keep your system plugged in during this process, to avoid sudden power loss
  - When `walk returned 0` appears, the process is complete
19. Once finished, press **Select** to quit twlnf
20. Press **A** to confirm
  - Your console will power off
21. Insert your <2GB SD card into your PC
22. Move all files from the `dump` directory to the root of the SD card
  - This prepares the "SD NAND",  which HiyaCFW will boot from
23. Navigate to the HiyaCFW `for PC` folder
24. Run `hiyacfw_helper.py` to prepare modifications
  - This script requires [WINE](https://www.winehq.org/){:target="_blank"} on Mac/Linux/*nix systems
25. Open the new `Modified Files` folder
26. Copy `bootloader.nds` to the root of your <2GB SD card
27. Copy 00000002.app to **title > 00030017 > 484e41XX > content** folder on your <2GB SD card
28. Copy *the contents of* the HiyaCFW `for 2GB (or lower) SD card (SDNAND)` folder to the root of your <2GB SD card
29. Unplug your <2GB SD card, and insert it in your DSi
30. Power on your console
  - HiyaCFW's splash screen should appear

Your system should now boot from the SD card instead of the internal NAND.
