Many files in this directory are not covered by the MIT license that the rest of the guide is. This is due to some of the files not being our own.
Files are here because they are either not distributed in binary form and have been compiled separately, have been repacked to make installation easier, or are written by us to make things more comprehensible for the end-user.
