It is important to note that we didn't do a lot of the work; all we have done is create a guide to help the community modify their DSi systems easier. You may want to donate to the exploit developers instead, who have put in countless hours of work in order to make the resources here available at no charge.

In any case, here are the PayPal links for the guide maintainers you can use if you really mean to:
